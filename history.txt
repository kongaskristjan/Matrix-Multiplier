Multiply versions on i5-4200u (2 * 1000x1000 in seconds single-threaded):
Simple 7.12
Simple * AVX 0.70
Several non-working
4x4   - ?
8x8v1 - ~0.25
8x8v2 - 0.245
8x8v3 + 16x16 - 0.165

Difference between Simple*AVX and best version might seem small,
however the first does not benefit at all from more threads while the
latter does relatively well.
